\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

Before starting the optimisation process, we need to define the problem in mathematical terms.
The goal of the project is to minimise the compliance $C$ of the structure subjected to a volume constraint $V - V_0 \le 0$.

In the following sections, we will give an overview of the equations and the theroetical background needed to solve the problem.
We will then move on to the implementation of the optimisation algorithm and the results obtained.
